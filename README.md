# Eventish

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/eventish.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/eventish)
[![Specs](https://github.com/blocknotes/eventish/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/blocknotes/eventish/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Yet another opinionated events library which proposes a simple API to handle... events ðŸŽ‰

The main features:
- _composable_: just require the components that you need;
- with _adapters_: support ActiveSupport::Notifications for pub/sub events;
- with _async events_: support ActiveJob for background execution.

## Install

- Add to your Gemfile: `gem 'eventish'` (and execute `bundle`)
- Create an initializer - _config/initializers/eventish.rb_:

```rb
require 'eventish/adapters/active_support'

Eventish.setup do |config|
  config.adapter = Eventish::Adapters::ActiveSupport
end

Rails.configuration.to_prepare do
  # NOTE: required to load the event descendants when eager_load is off
  unless Rails.configuration.eager_load
    events = Rails.root.join('app/events/**/*.rb').to_s
    Dir[events].sort.each { |event| require event }
  end
end

Rails.configuration.after_initialize do
  Eventish::SimpleEvent.subscribe_all # NOTE: events will be available after this point

  Eventish.publish('app_loaded') # just a test event
end
```

- Create some events - _app/events/main/app_loaded_event.rb_:

```rb
module Main
  class AppLoadedEvent < Eventish::SimpleEvent
    def call(_none, _options = {})
      puts '> App loaded event'
    end
  end
end
```

For a complete example please take a look at the [dummy app](spec/dummy) in the specs.

### Adatpers

Only _ActiveSupport_ is supported for now.

```rb
# initializer setup
require 'eventish/adapters/active_support'

Eventish.setup do |config|
  config.adapter = Eventish::Adapters::ActiveSupport
end
```

### Simple events

Generic events not related to a specific component.

```rb
# initializer setup
Rails.configuration.after_initialize do
  # Subscribe all Eventish::SimpleEvent descendants using the configured adapter
  # The descendants event classes must be loaded before this point - see eager_load notes in the Install section
  Eventish::SimpleEvent.subscribe_all
end
```

Sample event - _app/events/main/test_event.rb_:

```rb
module Main
  class TestEvent < Eventish::SimpleEvent
    def call(_none, _options = {})
      puts '> A test event'
    end

    class << self
      def event_name
        # this is optional, if not set the class name to string will be used
        'some_event'
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Publish the event: `Eventish.publish('some_event')`

### Async events

Events executed in a background process. Only _ActiveJob_ is supported for now.

```rb
# initializer setup
require 'eventish/active_job_event'

Rails.configuration.after_initialize do
  Eventish::ActiveJobEvent.subscribe_all
end
```

Sample event - _app/events/notifications/user_after_save_commit_event.rb_:

```rb
module Notifications
  class UserAfterCommitEvent < Eventish::ActiveJobEvent
    def call(user, _options = {})
      Rails.logger.info ">>> User ##{user.id} after commit notification"
    end
  end
end
```

## Do you like it? Star it!

If you use this component just star it. A developer is more motivated to improve a project when there is some interest.
